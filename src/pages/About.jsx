        <h1>A bit about me...</h1>
        <div className='about-text'>
          <p>Iâ€™m a software engineer with a background in program development, client communications, and artmaking. I am interested in working with a broad range of high-impact technologies to build innovative products. I want to use creativity and responsive design as tools that empower users to communicate ideas, find resources, and connect in meaningful ways. I know the important things take hard work, and I bring those values with me when I take on new projects.</p>
          <br/>
          <p> In my spare time, I enjoy outdoor adventures like hiking and rock climbing, petting every dog I meet, and watercolor painting.</p>
