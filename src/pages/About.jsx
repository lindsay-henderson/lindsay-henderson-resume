      <div className='about-text'>
        <p>Iâ€™m a software engineer with a background in nonprofits and artmaking. I am interested in working with a broad range of high-impact technologies to build innovative products. I want to use creativity and responsive design as tools that empower users to communicate ideas, find resources, and connect in meaningful ways. I know the important things take hard work, and I bring those values with me when I take on new projects.</p>
