        <h1>A Bit About Me...</h1>
        <div className='about-text'>
          <p>Iâ€™m a software engineer with a background in program development, client communications, and artmaking. I'm excited about using creativity and responsive design as tools that empower users to communicate, find resources, and connect in meaningful ways. I know the important things take hard work, and I bring those values with me when I take on new projects.</p>
          <p> In my spare time, I enjoy outdoor adventures like hiking and rock climbing, petting every dog I meet, and watercolor painting.</p>
